# Appathon2018
This app reads a pdf that the users gives it, with typed or handwritten text, and turns it into an interactive experience.
The user can make the app read the text out loud, define a word, summarize the text, and more!
I made this app for a Hackathon at Georgia Tech and won third place!
This will help students or professionals who have to study long, boring text and would rather have it be more interactive!
